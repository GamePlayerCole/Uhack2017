# HungryHub
HungryHub was an app I made with a team of other college students to win Best Web and Mobile App Development for UHack 2017 hackathon.

## Rewrite
HungryHub was orginally written as a prototype idea for a hackathon. While a successful project at the time, we had to take some shortcuts in order to get the project to work in such a short amount of time. Currently, I'm learning how to write ASP.Net Core MVC web apps, and I think it'd be a fun weekend project to work up a more stable rewrite of the project.

## What it does
You provide your location and desired radius to be within for the place you would like to eat at and Hungry Hub will suggest a place to you based on the parameters. Still undecided? Go ahead an click "Nope, gimme another" and Hungry Hub will suggest another place.
